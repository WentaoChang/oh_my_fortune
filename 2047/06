WOLF:
	A man who knows all the ankles.


Pure drivel tends to drive ordinary drivel off of the TV screen.


You have the power to influence all with whom you come in contact.


I went over to my friend, he was eatin' a pickle.
I said "Hi, what's happenin'?"
He said "Nothin'."
Try to sing this song with that kind of enthusiasm;
As if you just squashed a cop.
		-- Arlo Guthrie, "Motorcycle Song"
