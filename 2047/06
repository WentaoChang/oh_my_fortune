He said "Nothin'."
Try to sing this song with that kind of enthusiasm;
As if you just squashed a cop.

The acrobats - Tom and Louise-

	They crawl down the aisle
	While screwing dog-style,
As the orchestra plays Kilmer's "Trees."


Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather
a new wearer of clothes.
		-- Henry David Thoreau
