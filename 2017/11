representation of contemporary reality cannot be taken seriously as a
representation of anything -- except a show to be ignored by anyone
capable of sitting upright in a chair and chewing gum simultaneously.

Whether weary or unweary, O man, do not rest,
Do not cease your single-handed struggle.
Go on, do not rest.
		-- An old Gujarati hymn


Well, Jim, I'm not much of an actor either.


If I'd known computer science was going to be like this,
I'd never have given up being a rock 'n' roll star.

Put not your trust in money, but put your money in trust.
