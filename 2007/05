THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #17 -- SARTRE

	Named after the late existential philosopher, SARTRE is an extremely

	"Can you hammer a 6-inch spike into a wooden plank with your
penis?"

Epperson's law:
	When a man says it's a silly, childish game, it's probably
	something his wife can beat him at.


A bachelor is a man who never made the same mistake once.
