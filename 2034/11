vacations at this country inn.  The last time he'd finally managed an

he cried.  "I would have rushed up here, we could have gotten married,
and the baby would have my name!"

we sat up all night talkin' and talkin' and finally decided it would be
better to have a bastard in the family than a lawyer."
