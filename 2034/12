	This guy is taking a leak in a public men's room when a man enters
with his arms held out from his sides, bent at the elbows with his hands
dangling awkwardly, and comes over to him.

guy follows orders, wincing at his own embarrassment and at the shame of
being so helpless.

*thing* 'til my nails dry!"
