Hitchcock's Staple Principle:
	The stapler runs out of staples
	only while you are trying to staple something.


Heaven, n.:
	A place where the wicked cease from troubling you with talk of
	their personal affairs, and the good listen with attention
	while you expound your own.
		-- Ambrose Bierce, "The Devil's Dictionary"


Try to get all of your posthumous medals in advance.


Ask yourself whether you are happy and you cease to be so.
		-- John Stuart Mill
