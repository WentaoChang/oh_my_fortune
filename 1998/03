Hitchcock's Staple Principle:
	The stapler runs out of staples
	only while you are trying to staple something.


Heaven, n.:
	A place where the wicked cease from troubling you with talk of
	their personal affairs, and the good listen with attention
	while you expound your own.
		-- Ambrose Bierce, "The Devil's Dictionary"
