In a five year period we can get one superb programming language.
Only we can't control when the five year period will begin.


When in calling, plain speaking is out;
When the ladies (God bless 'em) are milling about,
You may wet, make water, or empty the glass;
You can powder your nose, or the "johnny" will pass.
It's a drain for the lily, or man about dog
When everyone's drunk, it's condensing the fog;
But sure as the devil, that word with a hiss
It's only in Shakespeare that characters ____.
		-- Ogden Nash


All that glitters has a high refractive index.


A man always needs to remember one thing about
a beautiful woman.  Somewhere, somebody's tired of her.
