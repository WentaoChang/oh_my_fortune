Try to divide your time evenly to keep others happy.


Virtue is not left to stand alone.
He who practices it will have neighbors.
		-- Confucius


A cloud does not know why it moves in just such a direction and at such
a speed, if feels an impulsion... this is the place to go now.  But the
sky knows the reasons and the patterns behind all clouds, and you will
know, too, when you lift yourself high enough to see beyond horizons.
