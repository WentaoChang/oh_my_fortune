Ethnologists up with the Sioux
Wired home for two punts, one canoe.
	The answer next day,
	Said, "Girls on the way,
But what the hell's a `panoe'?"


Finagle's Creed:
	Science is true.  Don't be misled by facts.


Death is a spirit leaving a body, sort
of like a shell leaving the nut behind.

San Francisco has always been my favorite booing city.  I don't mean the
people boo louder or longer, but there is a very special intimacy.  When
they boo you, you know they mean *you*.  Music, that's what it is to me.
One time in Kezar Stadium they gave me a standing boo.

It was a brave man that ate the first oyster.
