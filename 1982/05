"You are old, Father William," the young man said,
	"All your papers these days look the same;
Those William's would be better unread --

But the great reputation I found that I'd won,
	Made it pointless to think any more."

operating under noises being extremely suppressed" etc.

world put together.

Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth but supreme beauty --
a beauty cold and austere, like that of a sculpture, without appeal to any
part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trapping of painting or music,
yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the
greatest art can show.  The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense
of being more than man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is
to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.
		-- Bertrand Russell

house."
	"No, no, my dear," said the president sleepily, "in the Senate
maybe, but not in the House."

Do you put pennies in the slots in your penny loafers?
Does your bow-tie flash "hey you kid" in red neon at parties?
Do you think pizza before noon is unhealthy?
Do you use the "greasy kid's stuff" to stick down your cowlick?
Do you wear a "nerd-pack" in your shirt pocket to keep the dozen

My love runs by like a day in June,
	And he makes no friends of sorrows.
He'll tread his galloping rigadoon

He'll live his days where the sunbeams start
	Nor could storm or wind uproot him.
My own dear love, he is all my heart --
	And I wish somebody'd shoot him.

There are revolutions that are sweeping the world and we in America
have been in a position of trying to stop them.  With all the wealth of

oppressive.  They are revolutions against feudalism.  [1952]

Bistromathics is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the
behavior of numbers.  Just as Einstein observed that space was not an
absolute, but depended on the observer's movement in space, and that
time was not an absolute, but depended on the observer's movement in
time, so it is now realized that numbers are not absolute, but depend
on the observer's movement in restaurants.
