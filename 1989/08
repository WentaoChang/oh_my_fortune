There is nothing so easy but that it becomes difficult
when you do it reluctantly.
		-- Publius Terentius Afer (Terence)


Loneliness is a terrible price to pay for independence.


He's learned about 50% of the rules of sex and conversation;
he knows how to stick it in, but not how to stick it out.


PAIN:
	Sliding down a 50-foot razor blade into a bucket of alcohol.


Questionable day.
Ask somebody something.


LOVE:
	Love ties in a knot in the end of the rope.


Once you come out as a Pagan bisexual married leatherdyke,
the rest of life is that much easier.


Be cautious in your daily affairs.
