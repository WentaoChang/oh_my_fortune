Star Wars is adolescent nonsense; Close Encounters is obscurantist drivel;
Star Trek can turn your brains to puree of bat guano; and the greatest
science fiction series of all time is Doctor Who!  And I'll take you all
on, one-by-one or all in a bunch to back it up!

Sacher's Observation:
	Some people grow with responsibility -- others merely swell.


Some people have no respect for age unless it's bottled.


Save the whales.  Collect the whole set.
