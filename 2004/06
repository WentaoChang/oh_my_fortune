husband and screamed, "Erlenmeyer!  My joules!  Someone has stolen my

a moment.  Perhaps they're mislead."

"No, I know they're stolen," cried Florence.  "I remember putting them

said the outrage looked like the work of an arch-criminal by the name

	Since her mind is my own,
	She'll be thinking of nothing but sex.
