Hotels are tired of getting ripped off.  I checked into a hotel and they

No problem is so large it can't be fit in somewhere.


A diva who specializes in risqu'e arias is an off-coloratura soprano.


One seldom sees a monument to a committee.


A man may well bring a horse to the water,
but he cannot make him drink with he will.
