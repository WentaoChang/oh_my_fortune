Democracy is good.  I say this because other systems are worse.
		-- Jawaharlal Nehru


She's so tough she won't take 'yes' for an answer.


How kind of you to be willing to live someone's life for them.


It's just a jump to the left
	And then a step to the right.
Put your hands on your hips
	You bring your knees in tight.
But it's the pelvic thrust
	That really drives you insa-a-a-a-a-ane!

	LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!
