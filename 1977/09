Drilling for oil is boring.


Kludge, n.:
	An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a
	distressing whole.

Tell me why the stars do shine,
Tell me why the ivy twines,
Tell me why the sky's so blue,
And I will tell you just why I love you.

	Nuclear fusion makes stars to shine,
	Phototropism makes ivy twine,
	Rayleigh scattering makes sky so blue,
	Sexual hormones are why I love you.
