It landed by the kitchen door.
Oh, I'm looking over, my dead dog rover,
that ain't gonna walk no more...

Lay for days in a sexual merger.

	"Won't you ever withdraw?"
He replied with a yawn, "It's inertia."

In fact, it is as difficult to appropriate the thoughts of others

		[to which I reply, "You think it's easy for me to
		misconstrue all these misquotations?!?"  Ed.]
