Remember, drive defensively!  And of course, the best defense is a good
offense!


Ideas don't stay in some minds very long because they don't like
solitary confinement.


I can't understand why a person will take a year or two to write a
novel when he can easily buy one for a few dollars.

The Great Bald Swamp Hedgehog:
	The Great Bald Swamp Hedgehog of Billericay displays, in
courtship, his single prickle and does impressions of Holiday Inn desk
clerks.  Since this means him standing motionless for enormous periods
of time he is often eaten in full display by The Great Bald Swamp
Hedgehog Eater.

your good liquor at BYOB parties?  Take along a candle, which you insert
and light after you've opened the bottle.  No one ever expects anything
drinkable to be in a bottle which has a candle stuck in its neck.
