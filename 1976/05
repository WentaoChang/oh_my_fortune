together for years, virtually inseparable.  Unfortunately, one of them is
struck by a truck and killed.  About a week later his friend wakes up in

I'm playing with Bird, and 'Trane, and Count Basie drops in all the time!

	"Oh, wow!" says his friend. "That sounds fantastic, tell me more,

	"The bad news is that God has this girlfriend that sings..."

Ask your boss to reconsider --
It's so difficult to take "Go to hell" for an answer.


Oh, give me a home,
Where the buffalo roam,
And I'll show you a house with a really messy kitchen.
