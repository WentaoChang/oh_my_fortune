Tuesday After Lunch is the cosmic time of the week.


In a whiskey it's age, in a cigarette it's
taste and in a sports car it's impossible.


It is by the fortune of God that, in this country, we have three benefits:
freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and the wisdom never to use either.
		-- Mark Twain
