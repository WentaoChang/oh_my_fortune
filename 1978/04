A CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS:

7. PAY YOUR MEDICAL BILLS PROMPTLY AND WILLINGLY.
	You should consider it a privilege to contribute, however modestly,
	to the well-being of physicians and other humanitarians.

8. DO NOT SUFFER FROM AILMENTS THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD.
	It is sheer arrogance to contract illnesses that are beyond your means.

9. NEVER REVEAL ANY OF THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT IN THE COURSE
   OF TREATMENT BY YOUR DOCTOR.
	The patient-doctor relationship is a privileged one, and you have a
	sacred duty to protect him from exposure.

10. NEVER DIE WHILE IN YOUR DOCTOR'S PRESENCE OR UNDER HIS DIRECT CARE.
	This will only cause him needless inconvenience and embarrassment.


Hear about...

	company -- the photocopier got drunk and tried to undo the
	typewriter's ribbon?

The eyes of Texas are upon you,
All the livelong day;
The eyes of Texas are upon you,
You cannot get away;

The eyes of Texas are upon you
'Til Gabriel blows his horn.
		-- University of Texas' school song


Hell, if you don't try to remake someone,
how are they supposed to know you care?


Zall's Laws:
	1: Any time you get a mouthful of hot soup, the next thing you do

Parkinson's Fourth Law:
	The number of people in any working group tends to increase
	regardless of the amount of work to be done.


From the outset, the blind date was a fiasco and it was intensified by the
fact that the fellow was too insensitive and ego-ridden to realize it.  The
moment of truth came in the supper club as he clutched the girl's thigh and
whispered,
	"Baby, how's about our cutting out to my pad so I can slip you nine
inches?"
There was a moment of silence, and then the girl said,
	"You know, I really don't think you could get it up three times
in a row!"

shredding hundred dollar bills."

Crime does not pay... as well as politics.
		-- A. E. Neuman

talk to.  And you just HAVE to watch it.  "Blind, masochistic minority,

them too much on the next Oprah Winfrey."
