W. Lafayette may not be the asshole of the universe...

I never soiled with such a deed.
		-- A. E. Housman


	When the noted playwright George Bernard Shaw sent him two tickets to
the opening night of his new play with a note that read: "Bring a friend, if

your play can go fuck yourselves."

You will soon meet a person who will play an important role in your life.
