Given sufficient time, what you put
off doing today will get done by itself.


Evening hours "all clear" for romance!

... it still remains true that as a set of cognitive beliefs about the
existence of God in any recognizable sense continuous with the great
systems of the past, religious doctrines constitute a speculative
hypothesis of an extremely low order of probability.

Teachers have class.


Either I'm dead or my watch has stopped.

Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.


A halted retreat
Is nerve-wracking and dangerous.
To retain people as men -- and maidservants
Brings good fortune.
