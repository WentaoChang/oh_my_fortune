The IRS spends God knows how much of your tax money on these toll-free
information hot lines staffed by IRS employees, whose idea of a

And so, men, we can see that human skin is an even more complex and
fascinating organ than we thought it was, and if we want to keep it
looking good, we have to care for it as though it were our own.  One

youthful beauty is a career necessity, such as Elizabeth Taylor and
Orson Welles.
