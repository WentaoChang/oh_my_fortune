Well, didja wake up grouchy or did you let her sleep?


Everyone was born right-handed.
Only the greatest overcome it.


The passionate young thing was having a difficult time getting across what
she wanted from her rather dense boyfriend.  Finally she asked,
	"Would you like to see where I was operated on for appendicitis?"
	"Gosh, no!" he replied.  "I hate hospitals."


Those who make peaceful revolution impossible
will make violent revolution inevitable.
		-- John F. Kennedy
