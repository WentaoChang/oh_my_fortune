People are like onions -- you cut them up, and they make you cry.


Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet!


War is much too serious a matter to be entrusted to the military.
		-- Clemenceau


There is a time in the tides of men,
Which, taken at its flood, leads on to success.
On the other hand, don't count on it.
		-- T. K. Lawson
