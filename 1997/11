People are like onions -- you cut them up, and they make you cry.


Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet!


War is much too serious a matter to be entrusted to the military.
		-- Clemenceau


There is a time in the tides of men,
Which, taken at its flood, leads on to success.
On the other hand, don't count on it.
		-- T. K. Lawson


Your code should be more efficient!


I think that I shall never see
A thing as lovely as a tree.
But as you see the trees have gone
They went this morning with the dawn.
A logging firm from out of town
Came and chopped the trees all down.
But I will trick those dirty skunks
And write a brand new poem called "Trunks."


Eat as much as you like -- just don't swallow it.
