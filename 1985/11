to the assembler.

the Tao.
	But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.

Picking up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream,
I wonder how the old folks are tonight,
Her name was Ann, and I'll be damned if I recall her face,
She left me not knowing what to do.

Carefree Highway, let me slip away on you,
Carefree Highway, you seen better days,
The morning after blues, from my head down to my shoes,
Carefree Highway, let me slip away, slip away, on you...

Turning back the pages to the times I love best,
I wonder if she'll ever do the same,
Now the thing that I call livin' is just bein' satisfied,
With knowing I got noone left to blame.
Carefree Highway, I got to see you, my old flame...

Searching through the fragments of my dream shattered sleep,
I wonder if the years have closed her mind,
I guess it must be wanderlust or tryin' to get free,
From the good old faithful feelin' we once knew.
		-- Gordon Lightfoot, "Carefree Highway"

success.

In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun.
Find the fun and snap!  The job's a game.

		-- Mary Poppins

I waited and waited and when no message came I knew it must be from you.


I was in this prematurely air conditioned supermarket and there were all
these aisles and there were these bathing caps you could buy that had these

I wasn't tempted to buy one but I was reminded of the fact that I had been
avoiding the beach.
		-- Lucinda Childs "Einstein On The Beach"


Money can't buy happiness, but it can make you
awfully comfortable while you're being miserable.

ELECTRIC JELL-O

2   boxes JELL-O brand gelatin	2 packages Knox brand unflavored gelatin

size apartments "efficient" and incomprehensible artworks "innovative".  In
