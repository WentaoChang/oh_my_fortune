Have a coke and a smile!

In Seattle, Washington, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon that
is over six feet in length.


The time was the 19th of May, 1780.  The place was Hartford, Connecticut.
The day has gone down in New England history as a terrible foretaste of
Judgment Day.  For at noon the skies turned from blue to grey and by
mid-afternoon had blackened over so densely that, in that religious age,
men fell on their knees and begged a final blessing before the end came.
The Connecticut House of Representatives was in session.  And, as some of
the men fell down and others clamored for an immediate adjournment, the
Speaker of the House, one Col. Davenport, came to his feet.  He silenced
them and said these words: "The day of judgment is either approaching or
it is not.  If it is not, there is no cause for adjournment.  If it is, I
choose to be found doing my duty.  I wish therefore that candles may be
brought."

Rembrandt's first name was Beauregard, which is why he never used
it.

Perhaps the world's second-worst crime is boredom.  The first is
being a bore.

How can you say that the world isn't
Jewish, when the sun's real name is Sol?


Painters do it with even strokes.


Time washes clean
Love's wounds unseen.
That's what someone told me;
But I don't know what it means.
		-- Linda Ronstadt, "Long Long Time"
