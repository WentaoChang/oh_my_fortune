There are strange things done in the midnight sun

Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
	I cremated Sam McGee.

"Grasping Hold of Excellence", "Where to Hide Your Excellence at Night

It was pleasant to me to get a letter from you the other day.  Perhaps
I should have found it pleasanter if I had been able to decipher it.  I
don't think that I mastered anything beyond the date (which I knew) and
the signature (which I guessed at).  There's a singular and a perpetual
charm in a letter of yours; it never grows old, it never loses its
novelty.  Other letters are read and thrown away and forgotten, but
yours are kept forever -- unread.  One of them will last a reasonable
man a lifetime.
		-- Thomas Aldrich


PURITAN:
	Someone who is deathly afraid that
