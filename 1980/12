Cutler Webster's Law:

Instead of thinking of spam as a disease that might be eliminated,
it is more useful to think of it like crime, war and cockroaches.
It is not realistic to expect to eliminate any of these, no matter
how much anyone might wish otherwise. Therefore the best we can
hope to accomplish is to bring spam under reasonable control...

Once, I read that a man be never stronger
than when he truly realizes how weak he is.

It doesn't matter what you do, it only matters what you say you've
done and what you're going to do.
