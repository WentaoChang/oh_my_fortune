All the passions make us commit faults; love makes us commit the most
ridiculous ones.
		-- Francois de La Rochefoucauld


Life is too short to stuff a mushroom.

Paul's Law:
	In America, it's not how much an item costs, it's how much you
	save.


After your lover has gone you will still have PEANUT BUTTER!
