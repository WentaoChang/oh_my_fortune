If you are shooting under 80 you are neglecting your business;
over 80 you are neglecting your golf.

The bugs you have to avoid are the ones that give the user not only

Life is like a penis: when it's soft you can't beat it, and when it's
hard you get fucked.


The Illiterati Programus Canto 1:
	A program is a lot like a nose:
	Sometimes it runs, and sometimes it blows.


Harrisberger's Fourth Law of the Lab:
	Experience is directly proportional to the amount of
	equipment ruined.


The Third Law of Photography:
	If you did manage to get any good shots, they will be ruined
	when someone inadvertently opens the darkroom door and all of
	the dark leaks out.
