If you're worried by earthquakes and nuclear war,

My own dear love, he is strong and bold
	And he cares not what comes after.
His words ring sweet as a chime of gold,
	And his eyes are lit with laughter.
He is jubilant as a flag unfurled --

My own dear love, he is all my world --
	And I wish I'd never met him.
		-- Dorothy Parker, part 1
