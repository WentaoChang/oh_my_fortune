I do not remember ever having seen a sustained argument by an author which,
starting from philosophical premises likely to meet with general acceptance,

I cannot overemphasize the importance of good grammar.

What a crock.  I could easily overemphasize the importance of good
grammar.  For example, I could say: "Bad grammar is the leading cause
