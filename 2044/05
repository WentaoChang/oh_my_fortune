we're using work at a higher level, more removed from machine, peripheral
and operating system imperatives) than it was twenty years ago, and because
of this, knowledge of the internals of a system may become less accessible.
We may be able to dig deeper holes, but unless we know how to build taller

One Saturday afternoon, during the campaign to decide whether or not there
should be a Coastal Commission, I took a helicopter ride from Los Angeles

and the empty beach were within a quarter mile of each other.  Obviously

people won't go to because they prefer to be crowded together on one beach
is a ridiculous waste of our natural resources and our taxes.
