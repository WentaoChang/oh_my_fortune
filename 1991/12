Harry is heavily into camping, and every year in the late fall, he
makes us all go to Assateague, which is an island on the Atlantic Ocean
famous for its wild horses.  I realize that the concept of wild horses

down your tent and poop on your shoes.  We're protected by federal law,
just like Richard Nixon."
