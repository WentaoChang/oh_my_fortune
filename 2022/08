Only the hypocrite is really rotten to the core.

Which is worse: ignorance or apathy?  Who knows?  Who cares?


Be free and open and breezy!  Enjoy!
Things won't get any better so get used to it.


Q:	How many gradual (sorry, that's supposed to be "graduate") students
	does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
A:	"I'm afraid we don't know, but make my stipend tax-free, give my
	advisor a $30,000 grant of the taxpayer's money, and I'm sure he
	can tell me how to do the shit work for him so he can take the
	credit for answering this incredibly vital question."
