The Ancient Doctrine of Mind Over Matter:
	I don't mind... and you don't matter.

		-- As revealed to reporter G. Rivera by Swami Havabanana


Kiss a non-smoker; taste the difference.


The moss on the tree does not fear the talons of the hawk.


Are we running light with overbyte?


A political man can have as his aim the realization of freedom,
but he has no means to realize it other than through violence.
		-- Jean-Paul Sartre
