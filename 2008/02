I've known him as a man, as an adolescent and as a child -- sometimes
on the same day.


Marriage is a ghastly public confession of a strictly private intention.


I have lots of things in my pockets;
None of them is worth anything.
Sociopolitical whines aside,
Gan you give me, gratis, free,
The price of half a gallon
Of Gallo extra bad
And most of the bus fare home.


I try to keep an open mind, but not so open that my brains fall out.
