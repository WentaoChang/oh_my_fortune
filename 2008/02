I've known him as a man, as an adolescent and as a child -- sometimes
on the same day.


Marriage is a ghastly public confession of a strictly private intention.


I have lots of things in my pockets;
None of them is worth anything.
Sociopolitical whines aside,
Gan you give me, gratis, free,
The price of half a gallon
Of Gallo extra bad
And most of the bus fare home.


I try to keep an open mind, but not so open that my brains fall out.
		-- Judge Harold T. Stone


Seize the day, put no trust in the morrow!
		-- Quintus Horatius Flaccus (Horace)


The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through
three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry, and
Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why, and Where phases.  For
instance, the first phase is characterized by the question "How can we
eat?" the second by "Why do we eat?" and the third by "Where shall we
have lunch?".
		-- Douglas Adams, "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"
