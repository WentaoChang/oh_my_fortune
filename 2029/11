Bozo is the Brotherhood of Zips and Others.  Bozos are people who band
together for fun and profit.  They have no jobs.  Anybody who goes on a

They're the huge, fat, middle waist.  The archetype is an Irish drunk

like their comforts.  The Bozos have learned to enjoy their free time,
which is all the time.
