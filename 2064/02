A woman is like a dresser ... some man always goin' through her
drawers.
		-- Blind Lemon Pledge


Here's to the girl in little red shoes,
She drinks my liquor, she drinks my booze,
She has no cherry, but that's no sin,
She has the box the cherry came in.


The reverse side also has a reverse side.
		-- Japanese proverb


Women complain about sex more than men.  Their gripes fall into two
categories: (1) Not enough and (2) Too much.
