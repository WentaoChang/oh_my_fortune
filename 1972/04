Life can be so tragic -- you're here today and here tomorrow.


Who's on first?


Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet!


A hermit is a deserter from the army of humanity.


It was all so different before everything changed.


Eat the rich -- the poor are tough and stringy.


FORTUNE REMEMBERS THE GREAT MOTHERS: #5

	"And, and, and, and, but, but, but, but!"
		-- Mrs. Janice Markowsky, April 8, 1965


As you reach for the web, a venomous spider appears.  Unable to pull
your hand away in time, the spider promptly, but politely, bites you.
The venom takes affect quickly causing your lips to turn plaid along
with your complexion.  You become dazed, and in your stupor you fall
from the limbs of the tree.  Snap!  Your head falls off and rolls all
over the ground.  The instant before you croak, you hear the whoosh of
a vacuum being filled by the air surrounding your head.  Worse yet, the
spider is suing you for damages.


I'll turn over a new leaf.
		-- Miguel de Cervantes
