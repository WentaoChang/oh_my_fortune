You will always get the greatest recognition for the job you least like.


Anything labeled "NEW" and/or "IMPROVED" isn't.

your eyes - or just by staring into space.
		-- Marilyn Monroe


It says he made us all to be just like him.  So if we're dumb, then
god is dumb, and maybe even a little ugly on the side.
