Would you mind terribly much if I asked you to take your silly-assed
problem down the hall?


FreeBSD: It's 3am at night.  Do you know where your fairings are?


Until Eve arrived, this was a man's world.

Thinks't thou existence doth depend on time?
It doth; but actions are our epochs; mine
Have made my days and nights imperishable,
Endless, and all alike, as sands on the shore,
Innumerable atoms; and one desert,
Barren and cold, on which the wild waves break,
But nothing rests, save carcasses and wrecks,
Rocks, and the salt-surf weeds of bitterness.


A man may sometimes be forgiven the kiss to which he is not entitled,
but never the kiss he has not the initiative to claim.


We must!  We must!
We must increase our bust!
The bigger the better!
The tighter the sweater!
And the boys will think more of us!


C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre!


Let us never negotiate out of fear,
but let us never fear to negotiate.
		-- John F. Kennedy


No, I don't have a drinking problem.
I drink, I get drunk, I fall down.  No problem!


Lucas is the source of many of the components of the legendarily reliable
British automotive electrical systems.  Professionals call the company "The
Prince of Darkness".  Of course, if Lucas were to design and manufacture
nuclear weapons, World War III would never get off the ground.  The British
don't like warm beer any more than the Americans do.  The British drink warm
beer because they have Lucas refrigerators.


When I was eight years old I came home with tears in my eyes because some
kids had stolen my sandwich.  My father handed me an ice pick, and said,
"Next time, hit 'em first and hit 'em hard."

You can't go into the ring and be a nice guy.  I would go a month, two
months, without having sex.  It worked for me because it made me a
vicious animal. You can't fight if you have any compassion or anything
like that.
		-- Jake LaMotta


Gosh that takes me back... or is it forward?  That's the trouble with
time travel, you never can tell.

Hailing frequencies open, Captain.


Joe sat as his dying wife's bedside.
Her voice was little more than a whisper.
	"Joe, darling," she breathed, "I've got a confession to make
before I go.  I ... I'm the one who took the $10,000 from your safe...
I spent it on a fling with your best friend, Charles.  And it was I who
forced your mistress to leave the city.  And I am the one who reported
your income-tax evasion to the I.R.S..."
	"That's all right, dearest, don't give it a second thought,"
whispered Joe. "I'm the one who poisoned you."


Smoking is, as far as I'm concerned, the entire point of being an adult.

ASS:
	The masculine of "lass".


A woman takes off her claim to respect along with her garments.

	"Do you cheat on your wife?" asked the psychiatrist.
	"Who else?" answered the patient.


Why do seagulls live near the sea?
'Cause if they lived near the bay, they'd be called baygulls.


"Good health" is merely the slowest rate at which one can die.


Texas is Hell on woman and horses.

... we must counterpose the overwhelming judgment provided by consistent
observations and inferences by the thousands.  The earth is billions of
years old and its living creatures are linked by ties of evolutionary
descent.  Scientists stand accused of promoting dogma by so stating, but
do we brand people illiberal when they proclaim that the earth is neither
flat nor at the center of the universe?  Science *has* taught us some
things with confidence!  Evolution on an ancient earth is as well
established as our planet's shape and position.  Our continuing struggle
to understand how evolution happens (the "theory of evolution") does not
cast our documentation of its occurrence -- the "fact of evolution" --
into doubt.

Agnes' Law:
	Almost everything in life is easier to get into than out of.


Dull women have immaculate homes.


Nobody really knows what happiness is, until they're married.
And then it's too late.


The fashionable drawing rooms of London have always been happy to accept
outsiders -- if only on their own, albeit undemanding terms.  That is to
say, artists, so long as they are not too talented, men of humble birth,
so long as they have since amassed several million pounds, and socialists
so long as they are Tories.
		-- Christopher Booker


Snakes.  Why did it have to be snakes?
