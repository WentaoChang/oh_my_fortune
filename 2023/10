Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.
		-- Pink Floyd


I can't decide whether to commit suicide or go bowling.
		-- Florence Henderson


If men are not afraid to die,
it is of no avail to threaten them with death.

If men live in constant fear of dying,
And if breaking the law means a man will be killed,
Who will dare to break the law?

There is always an official executioner.
If you try to take his place,
It is like trying to be a master carpenter and cutting wood.
If you try to cut wood like a master carpenter,
	you will only hurt your hand.
		-- Tao Te Ching, "Lao Tsu, #74"


Think sideways!
		-- Ed De Bono
