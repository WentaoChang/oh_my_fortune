MONTANA:
	Where forty-three below keeps out the riff-raff.


Government's Law:
	There is an exception to all laws.


Latin is a language,
As dead as can be.
First it killed the Romans,
And now it's killing me.


Since we're all here, we must not be all there.

The cow is nothing but a machine which makes grass fit for us people to eat.

Ever notice that even the busiest people are
never too busy to tell you just how busy they are?


		The STAR WARS Song
	Sung to the tune of "Lola", by the Kinks:

I met him in a swamp down in Dagobah
Where it bubbles all the time like a giant cabinet soda
	S-O-D-A soda
I saw the little runt sitting there on a log
I asked him his name and in a raspy voice he said Yoda
	Y-O-D-A Yoda, Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo Yoda

Well I've been around but I ain't never seen
A guy who looks like a Muppet but he's wrinkled and green
	Oh my Yoda, Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo Yoda
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
How he can raise me in the air just by raising his hand
	Oh my Yoda, Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo Yoda, Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo Yoda
