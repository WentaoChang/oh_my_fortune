Kliban's First Law of Dining:
	Never eat anything bigger than your head.


Anyone can make an omelet with eggs.  The trick is to make one with
none.


Have an adequate day.


This land is my land, and only my land,
I've got a shotgun, and you ain't got one,
If you don't get off, I'll blow your head off,
This land is private property.
		-- Apologies to Woody Guthrie


Real computer scientists don't program in assembler.  They don't write
in anything less portable than a number two pencil.


You may be gone tomorrow, but that
doesn't mean that you weren't here today.


A beautiful man is paradise for the eyes, hell for the soul, and
purgatory for the purse.
