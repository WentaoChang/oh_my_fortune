The myth of romantic love holds that once you've fallen in love with the
perfect partner, you're home free.  Unfortunately, falling out of love
seems to be just as involuntary as falling into it.


Close the door, let me give you what you've been waiting for!!


A nymph hits you and steals your virginity.


Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do.
Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.
		-- Mark Twain


People are beginning to notice you.
Try dressing before you leave the house.
