ALBRECHT'S LAW:
	Social innovations tend to the level
	of minimum tolerable well-being.


I distrust a close-mouthed man.  He generally picks the wrong time to talk
and says the wrong things.  Talking's something you can't do judiciously,
unless you keep in practice.  Now, sir, we'll talk if you like.  I'll tell
you right out, I'm a man who likes talking to a man who likes to talk.
		-- Sidney Greenstreet, "The Maltese Falcon"


Time is a great teacher, but unfortunately it kills all its pupils.
