Spouse, n.:
	Someone who'll stand by you through all the trouble you
	wouldn't have had if you'd stayed single.


If you would keep a secret from an enemy, tell it not to a friend.


To a Californian, all New Yorkers are cold; even in heat they rarely go
above fifty-eight degrees.  If you collapse on a street in New York, plan

		-- From "East vs. West: The War Between the Coasts"


When one knows women one pities men,
but when one studies men, one excuses women.
		-- Horne Tooke


If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
