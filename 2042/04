The course of true anything never does run smooth.
		-- Samuel Butler


Naturally the common people don't want war... but after all it is the leaders
of a country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to
drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship,
or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.  Voice or no voice, the people
can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  That is easy.  All you
have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists
for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.  It works the same
in every country.
		-- Hermann Goering


A man in love is incomplete until he is married.  Then he is finished.

It is when I struggle to be brief that I become obscure.
		-- Quintus Horatius Flaccus (Horace)
