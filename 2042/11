If there really was a Jewish conspiracy to run the world, my rabbi would
have let me in on it by now.  I contribute enough to the shule.

All I really want in life is a piece and some quiet.


An atheist is a man with no invisible means of support.


If God had not given us sticky tape,
it would have been necessary to invent it.
