Experience is that marvelous thing that enables
you recognize a mistake when you make it again.

Hear about...
	the young lady attacked in San Francisco?
	By two men, one held her down while the other one did her hair.


A tall, dark stranger will have more fun than you.


You scratch my tape, and I'll scratch yours.


You have had a long-term stimulation relative to business.


The grass is always greener on the other side of your sunglasses.


If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to get
the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude.  See in
college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving the natural
method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting that you shall
learn what you have no taste or capacity for.  The college, which should
be a place of delightful labor, is made odious and unhealthy, and the
young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to rally their jaded spirits.
I would have the studies elective.  Scholarship is to be created not
by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge.  The wise
instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the
attractions the study has for himself.  The marking is a system for schools,
not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to
put on a professor.

Q:	How does a girl know she's sleeping with a Computer Scientist?
A:	It isn't hard.


All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies.

Always try to do things in chronological order; it's less confusing
that way.


Don't kid yourself.  Little is relevant, and nothing lasts forever.


It's reassuring to know that if you behave strangely enough,
society will take full responsibility for you.


Hartley's First Law:
	You can lead a horse to water, but if you can
	get him to float on his back, you've got something.
