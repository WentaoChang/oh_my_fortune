Experience is that marvelous thing that enables
you recognize a mistake when you make it again.
		-- Franklin Jones


Hear about...
	the young lady attacked in San Francisco?
	By two men, one held her down while the other one did her hair.


A tall, dark stranger will have more fun than you.


You scratch my tape, and I'll scratch yours.


You have had a long-term stimulation relative to business.


The grass is always greener on the other side of your sunglasses.
