Passionate hatred can give meaning and purpose to an empty life.
		-- Eric Hoffer


Would you mind terribly much if I asked you to take your silly-assed
problem down the hall?


If girls are all sugar and spice, why do they taste like anchovies?


Household hint:
	If you are out of cream for your coffee,
	mayonnaise makes a dandy substitute.
