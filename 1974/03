Mencken and Nathan's Fifteenth Law of The Average American:
	The worst actress in the company is always the manager's wife.


All of the animals except man know that
the principal business of life is to enjoy it.


My mother once said to me, "Elwood," (she always called me Elwood)
"Elwood, in this world you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant."
For years I tried smart.  I recommend pleasant.
		-- Elwood P. Dowde, "Harvey"
