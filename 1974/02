Viennese Oyster: Lady who can cross her feet behind her head, lying on her
back, of course.  When she has done so, you hold her tightly round each instep
with your full hand and squeeze, lying on her full-length.  Don't try to put
an unsupple partner into this position -- it can't be achieved by brute force.
You can get a very similar sensation -- unique rocking pelvic movement -- with
less expertise if she crosses her ankles on her tummy, knees to shoulders, and
you lie on her crossed ankles with your full weight.  Why "Viennese" we don't
know.  Tolerable for short periods only but gives tremendous genital pressure
for both.

Being a mime means never having to say you're sorry.


It's the same old story; boy meets beer, boy drinks beer...
boy gets another beer.

A conservative is a man
who believes that nothing should be done for the first time.
		-- Alfred E. Wiggam


It has been said that man is a rational animal.  All my life I have
been searching for evidence which could support this.
		-- Bertrand Russell


Ambition, n.:
	An overmastering desire to be vilified by enemies while

Newton's Fourth Law:  Every action has an equal and opposite satisfaction.


As the Catholic church becomes more and more tolerant, some day they will
have to consider the possibility of a gay pope.  Possibly the largest
issue will be having to decide whether he is "absolutely divine" or "just
simply marvelous."


Cruickshank's Law of Committees:
	If a committee is allowed to discuss a bad idea long enough, it
	will inevitably decide to implement the idea simply because so
	much work has already been done on it.


Oregano, n.:
	The ancient Italian art of pizza folding.


You can fool some of the people some of the time,
and some of the people all of the time, and that is sufficient.
