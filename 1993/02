What has roots as nobody sees,
Is taller than trees,
Up, up it goes,
And yet never grows?


Some men are alive simply because it is against the law to kill them.
		-- Edgar W. Howe


One evening a guru had coitus
With an actress, a whore and a poetess.
	When asked what position
	He used for coition,
He answered serenely, "the lotus."
