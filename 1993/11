	No matter where you stand, no matter how far or fast you flee,

You always introduce the younger person to the older person, using the
wording:  "Miss Brown, I'd like to introduce you to an older person"
(unless her name is not "Miss Brown").  If you do not know a person's
age, ask for a driver's license and a major credit card.  If you are
introduced to a member of a minority group, use the "high-five" style
handshake, followed by a remark designed to show you don't mind a bit,
such as "I see you are a (name of a minority group)!  Good!"

You are a wish to be here wishing yourself.

The road to hell is paved with good intentions.  And littered with
sloppy analysis!

TRUST ME:
	Get me, give me, buy me, do me.
