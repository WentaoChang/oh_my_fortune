Hier liegt ein Mann ganz ohnegleich;
Im Leibe dick, an Suenden reich.
Wir haben ihn ins Grab gesteckt,	Here lies a man with sundry flaws
Weil es uns duenkt er sei verreckt.	And numerous Sins upon his head;
					We buried him today because
					As far as we can tell, he's dead.

The only real advantage to punk music is that nobody can whistle it.

... "fire" does not matter, "earth" and "air" and "water" do not matter.
"I" do not matter.  No word matters.  But man forgets reality and remembers
words.  The more words he remembers, the cleverer do his fellows esteem him.
He looks upon the great transformations of the world, but he does not see
them as they were seen when man looked upon reality for the first time.
Their names come to his lips and he smiles as he tastes them, thinking he
knows them in the naming.
		-- Roger Zelazny, "Lord of Light"


The most pressing issue facing women today is finding a contraceptive

Said a decadent wench of Bombay:
"This has been a most wonderful day.
	Three cherry tarts,
	At least twenty farts,
Two shits, and a bloody fine lay."


Anyone can do any amount of work provided it isn't the work he is
supposed to be doing at the moment.

Gibson the Cat's Corollary:

of lunch meat.


WE:
	The single most important word in the world.


INTEREST:
	What borrowers pay, lenders receive, stockholders own, and
	burned out employees must feign.


If it doesn't smell yet, it's pretty fresh.
		-- Dave Johnson, on dead seagulls
