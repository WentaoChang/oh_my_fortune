Accidentally Shot
	Colonel Gray, of Petaluma, came near losing his life a few days ago,

stated, "The immediate task before us is to cut the Federal Government down

are just like [Lyndon Johnson's] programs.  They look good but they don't
work."

Our documentation manager was showing her two year old son around the
office.  He was introduced to me, at which time he pointed out that we
were both holding bags of popcorn.  We were both holding bottles of
juice.  But only *_h_e* had a lollipop.

He asked his mother, "Why doesn't HE have a lollipop?"

Her reply:

	"He can have a lollipop any time he wants to.  That's what it
	means to be a programmer."
