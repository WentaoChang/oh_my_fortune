You will gain money by a fattening action.


I was drunk last night, crawled home across the lawn.  By accident I
put the car key in the door lock.  The house started up.  So I figured
what the hell, and drove it around the block a few times.  I thought I
should go park it in the middle of the freeway and yell at everyone to
get off my driveway.

Every time I think I know where it's at, they move it.


It is the business of the future to be dangerous.

Yours is not to reason why,
Just to Sail Away.
And when you find you have to throw
Your Legacy away;
Remember life as was it is,
And is as it were;
Chasing sounds across the galaxy
'Till silence is but a blur.

A woman did what a woman had to, the best way she knew how.
To do more was impossible, to do less, unthinkable.
