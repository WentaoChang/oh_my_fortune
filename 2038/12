It's faster horses,
Younger women,
Older whiskey and
More money.

Pee-wee Recommends:

When Pee-wee Herman was arrested that evening in Sarasota, Florida,
the bill at the XXX South Trail Cinema featured:

	+ Nurse Nancy, starring Sandra Scream
	+ Turn Up the Heat, starring Savannah
	+ Tiger Shark, starring Raven


Playing an unamplified electric guitar is like strumming on a picnic
table.
