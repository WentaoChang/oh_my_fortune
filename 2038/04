	Tie me kangaroo down.
	Tie me kangaroo down, sport,
	Tie me kangaroo down.

	The geographical center of Boston is in Roxbury.  Due north of
the center we find the South End.  This is not to be confused with South
Boston which lies directly east from the South End.  North of the South
End is East Boston and southwest of East Boston is the North End.
