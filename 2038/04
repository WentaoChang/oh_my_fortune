Tan me hide when I'm dead, Fred,
Tan me hide when I'm dead.
So we tanned his hide when he died, Clyde,

	Tie me kangaroo down.
	Tie me kangaroo down, sport,
	Tie me kangaroo down.

He called for his pipe,
And he called for his bowl,
And he fiddled with his call girls three!

two new uses for sheep.  Meat and wool.


Pick another fortune cookie.
