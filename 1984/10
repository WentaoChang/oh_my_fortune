The difference between sentiment and sentimentality is easy to see.  When
you avoid killing somebody's pet on the glazeway, that's sentiment.  If you
swerve to avoid the pet and that causes you to kill pedestrians, THAT is
sentimentality.
		-- Frank Herbert, "Chapterhouse: Dune"


All most people want is a little more than they'll ever get.


"In the age of the internet attaching a famous name to your personal
opinion to give more weight to it is a very valid strategy."
