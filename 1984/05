Breeding rabbits is a hare raising experience.


Time is nature's way of making sure that
everything doesn't happen at once.

Space is nature's way of making sure that
everything doesn't happen to you.


SERENDIPITY:
	The process by which human knowledge is advanced.


Mental things which have not gone in through the
senses are vain and bring forth no truth except detrimental.
		-- Leonardo


I can see him a'comin'
With his big boots on,
With his big thumb out,
He wants to get me.
He wants to hurt me.
He wants to bring me down.
But some time later,
When I feel a little straighter,
I'll come across a stranger
Who'll remind me of the danger,
And then.... I'll run him over.
Pretty smart on my part!
To find my way... In the dark!
