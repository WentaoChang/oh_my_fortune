Breeding rabbits is a hare raising experience.


Time is nature's way of making sure that
everything doesn't happen at once.

Space is nature's way of making sure that
everything doesn't happen to you.


SERENDIPITY:
	The process by which human knowledge is advanced.


Mental things which have not gone in through the
senses are vain and bring forth no truth except detrimental.
