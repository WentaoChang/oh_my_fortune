Piping songs of pleasant glee,
On a cloud I saw a child,
And he laughing said to me:

"Piper, pipe that song again;"
So I piped: he wept to hear.

Sir, how may I ask you a question?
	(you must ask for retroactive question asking privileges for

	 number plus two, one for the current question, and one for the
	 next one)
Sir, may I ask nine questions?
	(go right ahead...)

"That definition's just."
The boy said naught but thought instead,
Remembering his pounded head:
"Force is not might but must!"
