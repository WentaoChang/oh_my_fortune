It was at the eighth annual mouse convention and mice from near and far had
gathered for the ball.  A pretty little female mouse waltzed by the stag
line and one of the males whistled a low, dirty whistle to himself.
Turning to  another mouse he said, "Look at the legs on that bitch, aren't
they beautiful?"
	"Just fair," was the answer.
	"You're crazy," said the first mouse and then turning to another,
asked his opinion.

about."
	"Some mice have no appreciation," exclaimed the first mouse.  "Now

	"To tell you the truth," was the reply, "I'm no authority on legs;
I'm a tit mouse myself."
