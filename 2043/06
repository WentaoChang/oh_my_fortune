Beware of geeks bearing graft.


No matter how much you do you never do enough.


	A man was reading The Canterbury Tales one Saturday morning, when his
wife asked "What have you got there?"  Replied he, "Just my cup and Chaucer."


If it happens once, it's a bug.
If it happens twice, it's a feature.
If it happens more than twice, it's a design philosophy.


It's no longer a question of staying healthy.  It's a question of finding
a sickness you like.
