Fuck art; let's dance!


Support mental health or I'LL KILL YOU!!!!


Was it you that did the pushin',
Left the stains upon the cushion,
The footprints on the dashboard upside-down?
Was it you, you little pecker,
That got into my Rebecca,
If you did, you'd better leave this town!

Yes, 'twas I that did the pushin',
Left the stains upon the cushion,
Footprints on the dashboard upside-down.
But since I stuck your daughter,
I've had trouble passin' water,
So I guess we're kind of even all around!


It's no surprise that things are so screwed up: everyone that knows how

BALTIMORE:
	A wharf-rat stealing Diogenes' lamp.


The feeling persists that no one can simultaneously be a respectable writer
and understand how a refrigerator works, just as no gentleman wears a brown
suit in the city.  Colleges may be to blame.  English majors are encouraged,
I know, to hate chemistry and physics, and to be proud because they are not
dull and creepy and humorless and war-oriented like the engineers across the
quad.  And our most impressive critics have commonly been such English majors,
and they are squeamish about technology to this very day.  So it is natural
for them to despise science fiction.
		-- Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., "Science Fiction"


Drop the vase and it will become a Ming of the past.
		-- The Adventurer


Didja' ever have to make up your mind,
Pick up on one and leave the other behind,

Didja' ever have to make up your mind?
		-- Lovin' Spoonful


Can't act.  Slightly bald.  Also dances.

"You are old," said the youth, "and your programs don't run,
	And there isn't one language you like;
Yet of useful suggestions for help you have none --
	Have you thought about taking a hike?"

"Since I never write programs," his father replied,
	"Every language looks equally bad;
Yet the people keep paying to read all my books
	And don't realize that they've been had."


Never say "Oops" in an operating room.


Some parts of the past must be preserved,
and some of the future prevented at all costs.


The farther you go, the less you know.
		-- Lao Tsu, "Tao Te Ching"


The only problem with being a man of leisure

	backfire when you learn that she was waiting for a bus.  Subdue
	impulse you have to push her out into traffic.


If you're gonna sleep with someone whose moral code may be written
in Fortran for all you know, at least make sure there's an existing
friendship of some sort to fall back on if things don't work out
like one or the other of you planned.


Love is never asking why?


The sudden sight of me causes panic in the streets. They have
yet to learn - only the savage fears what he does not understand.
		-- The Silver Surfer


Everyone has the right, without exception, to equal pay for equal work.
Except for women.


The personal computer market is about the same size as the total potato chip
market.  Next year it will be about half the size of the pet food market and
is fast approaching the total worldwide sales of pantyhose"
		-- James Finke, Commodore Int'l Ltd., 1982
