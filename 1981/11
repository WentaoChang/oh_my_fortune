The way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost.


When we talk of tomorrow, the gods laugh.


What you don't know can hurt you, only you won't know it.


What garlic is to food, insanity is to art.


I never met a man I didn't want to fight.
		-- Lyle Alzado, professional football lineman


Life is knowing how far to go without crossing the line.
