Please don't put a strain on our friendship
by asking me to do something for you.


Furious activity is no substitute for understanding.
		-- H. H. Williams


Only two groups of people fall for flattery -- men and women.


Yours is not to reason why,
Just to Sail Away.
And when you find you have to throw
Your Legacy away;
Remember life as was it is,
And is as it were;
Chasing sounds across the galaxy
'Till silence is but a blur.
		-- QYX
