Your responsibility as a parent is not as great as you might imagine.  You
need not supply the world with the next conqueror of disease or major motion
picture star.  If your child simply grows up to be someone who does not use
the word "collectible" as a noun, you can consider yourself an unqualified
success.
		-- Fran Lebowitz, "Social Studies"


Many people are desperately looking for some wise advice
which will recommend that they do what they want to do.


An age is called Dark not because the light fails to shine, but because
people refuse to see it.
		-- James Michener, "Space"
