The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness.
		-- John Muir


When you go out to buy, don't show your silver.


The end of labor is to gain leisure.


If some people didn't tell you,
you'd never know they'd been away on vacation.


There was a little girl
Who had a little curl
Right in the middle of her forehead.
When she was good, she was very, very good
And when she was bad, she was very, very popular.
		-- Max Miller, "The Max Miller Blue Book"
