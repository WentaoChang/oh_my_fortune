Grand Master Turing once dreamed that he was a machine.  When he awoke
he exclaimed:
	"I don't know whether I am Turing dreaming that I am a machine,
	or a machine dreaming that I am Turing!"
		-- Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming"


Say many of cameras focused t'us,
Our middle-aged shots do us justice.
No justice, please, curse ye!
We really want mercy:
You see, 'tis the justice, disgusts us.
		-- Thomas H. Hildebrandt


Stupidity got us into this mess -- why can't it get us out?


Nice boy, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mice.
		-- Foghorn Leghorn


Hear about...
	the swinger who labeled his little black book "Future Shack"?
