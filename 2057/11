From beating my meat, against the seat,
Of a bicycle built for two.

April, June, and no wonder.
all the rest have peanut butter
except my father who wears red suspenders.


You may be right, I may be crazy,
But maybe it's a lunatic you're looking for?

Never negotiate with the United States unless you have a nuclear
