Don't wake me up too soon...
Gonna take a ride across the moon...
You and me.

This means that only left handed people are in their right mind.


What has roots as nobody sees,
Is taller than trees,
Up, up it goes,
And yet never grows?


When arguments fail, use a blackjack.

Happiness is the greatest good.


Coitus is punishment for the happiness of being together.  Live as

The Kosher Dill was invented in 1723 by Joe Kosher and Sam Dill.  It is
the single most popular pickle variety today, enjoyed throughout the free
world by man, woman and child alike.  An astounding 350 billion kosher
dills are eaten each year, averaging out to almost 1/4 pickle per person
per day.  New York Times food critic Mimi Sheraton says "The kosher dill
really changed my life.  I used to enjoy eating McDonald's hamburgers and
drinking Iron City Lite, and then I encountered the kosher dill pickle.
I realized that there was far more to haute cuisine then I'd ever imagined.
And now, just look at me."
