What we need in this country, instead of Daylight Savings Time, which
nobody really understands anyway, is a new concept called Weekday
Morning Time, whereby at 7 a.m. every weekday we go into a space-
launch-style "hold" for two to three hours, during which it just
remains 7 a.m.  This way we could all wake up via a civilized gradual
process of stretching and belching and scratching, and it would still
be only 7 a.m. when we were ready to actually emerge from bed.

well-defined ones.  Those who admire the massive, rigid bone structures
of dinosaurs should remember that jellyfish still enjoy their very
secure ecological niche.

Good night, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are.


This fortune cookie program out of order.  For those in desperate
need, please use the program "randchar".  This program generates
random characters, and, given enough time, will undoubtedly come
up with something profound.  It will, however, take it no time at
all to be more profound than THIS program has ever been.


Actors will happen even in the best-regulated families.


The British are coming!  The British are coming!


Have you reconsidered a computer career?


No friendship is so cordial or so delicious as that of girl for girl;
no hatred so intense or immovable as that of woman for woman.

Kids always brighten up a house; mostly by leaving the lights on.


And it should be the law: If you use the word `paradigm' without knowing
what the dictionary says it means, you go to jail.  No exceptions.

The trouble with opportunity is that it
always comes disguised as hard work.

In short, _N is Richardian if, and only if, _N is not Richardian.


That, that is, is.
That, that is not, is not.
That, that is, is not that, that is not.

	He wanted to nail her,
So Gail made bail with her tail.
