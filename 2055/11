Mystics always hope that science will some day overtake them.

It is illegal to drive more than two thousand sheep down Hollywood
Boulevard at one time.


I met a young man in Chungking
Who had a very long thing --
	But you'll guess my surprise
	When I found that its size
Just measured a third-finger ring!
