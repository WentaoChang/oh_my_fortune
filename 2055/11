Mystics always hope that science will some day overtake them.
		-- Booth Tarkington


It is illegal to drive more than two thousand sheep down Hollywood
Boulevard at one time.


I met a young man in Chungking
Who had a very long thing --
	But you'll guess my surprise
	When I found that its size
Just measured a third-finger ring!


Oh wad some power the giftie gie us
To see oursel's as others see us!
It wad frae monie a blunder free us,
And foolish notion.
		-- Robert Burns, National Poet of Scotland, 1759-1796
