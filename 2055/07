A child of five could understand this!  Fetch me a child of five.


If you teach your children to like computers and to know how to gamble
then they'll always be interested in something and won't come to no real
harm.


The knowledge that makes us cherish
innocence makes innocence unattainable.
		-- Irving Howe


The sun was shining brightly		The breeze was blowing briskly,
And I could hardly wait,		It made the flowers sway,
To ponder at my window			The garden was enchanting
And gaze at my estate.			On this inspiring day.

My eyes fell on a little bird,		I smiled at him cheerfully
With a beautiful yellow bill,		And gave him a crust of bread,
I beckoned him to come and light	And then I closed the window
Upon my window sill.			And smashed his fucking head.
		-- "Good Morning", Debbie Smith
