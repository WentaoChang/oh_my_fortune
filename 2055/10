I don't believe in astrology.  But then I'm an Aquarius, and Aquarians
don't believe in astrology.
		-- James R. F. Quirk


The spouse of a pretty young thing
Came home from the wars in the spring.
	He was lame but he came
	With his dame like a flame --
A discharge is a wonderful thing.


Kent's Heuristic:
	Look for it first where you'd most like to find it.


An American is a man with two arms and four wheels.
		-- A Chinese child


A soft answer turneth away wrath; but grievous words stir up anger.
		-- Proverbs 15:1
