The health of a democratic society may be measured by the quality
of functions performed by private citizens.

SCORPIO (Oct 23 - Nov 21)
	You are shrewd in business and cannot be trusted.  You will achieve
	the pinnacle of success because of your total lack of ethics.  Most
	Scorpio people are murdered.


LIVING YOUR LIFE:
	A task so difficult, it has never been attempted before.
