YOUR FOAMY FUTURE
	by Miss Fortune

type of champagne to take to the neighbors Halloween Party.  Just take beer!

California Halloween is redundant anyhow.

fascinated by your intelligence, your wit, your drinking ability, and your
bank account.  Just make sure you realize it's far more impressive when
