The bigger the theory the better.


Hear about...
	the fellow who got ten years for pumping Ethyl behind the station?


Romeo was restless, he was ready to kill,
He jumped out the window 'cause he couldn't sit still,
Juliet was waiting with a safety net,
Said "don't bury me 'cause I ain't dead yet".
		-- Elvis Costello
