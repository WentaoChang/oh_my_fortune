The voluptuous blond was chatting with her handsome escort in a posh
restaurant when their waiter, stumbling as he brought their drinks,
dumped a martini on the rocks down the back of the blonde's dress.  She
sprang to her feet with a wild rebel yell, dashed wildly around the table,
then galloped wriggling from the room followed by her distraught boyfriend.
A man seated on the other side of the room with a date of his own beckoned
to the waiter and said, "We'll have two of whatever she was drinking."


Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.

picture of this.'  I said, 'No, Keith, we *don't* need a picture of this.'"

A committee takes root and grows, it flowers, wilts and dies,
scattering the seed from which other committees will bloom.
