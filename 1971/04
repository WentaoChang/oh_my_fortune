FORTUNE TESTS THE GREAT MANAGERS: #9

in the plushest office you've ever seen.  The enchilada casserole and
egg salad sandwich you had for lunch react, creating severe pressure.
Your sphincter loses control and you break wind, causing the glass
bookcase doors to shatter and a secretary to pass out.  You:

	(b) Point to the Chief Executive and accuse him of the offense.
	(c) Challenge anyone in the room to do better.
