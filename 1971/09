supported by reason and authority that positive testimony is entitled to
more weight than negative testimony, but by the latter term is meant

negative, because testimony in support of a negative may be as positive

Cut your hair close and shine all your shoes."

Oh Teacher, my Teacher, your life with me share.
What books ought I read?  What thoughts do I dare?

Are all races equal?  Are laws just and fair?
