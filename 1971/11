It is much harder to find a job than to keep one.


It is always the best policy to tell the truth, unless, of course,
you are an exceptionally good liar.
		-- Jerome K. Jerome


You are always doing something marginal when the boss drops by your desk.


	WARNING TO ALL PERSONNEL:

Firings will continue until morale improves.
