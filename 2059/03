You can grovel with a lover, you can grovel with a friend,
You can grovel with your boss, and it never has to end.

		Grovel, grovel, grovel, in your own peculiar way.

You can grovel in a hallway, you can grovel in a park,
You can grovel in an alley with a mugger after dark.
(chorus)

You can grovel with your uncle, you can grovel with your aunt,
You can grovel with your Apple, even though you say you can't.

A foe to rest and peaceful slumber.
