The honeymoon is over when a quickie before dinner refers to a short drink.


Sometimes the best medicine is to stop taking something.


My girlfriend and I sure had a good time at the beach last summer.  First
she'd bury me in the sand, then I'd bury her.  This summer I'm going to go
back and dig her up.
