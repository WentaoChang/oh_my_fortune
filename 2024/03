Fess:	Well, you must admit there is something innately humorous about
	a man chasing an invention of his own halfway across the galaxy.

	basic difference between robots and humans?
Fess:	What, the ability to form imaginary constructs?
Rod:	No, the ability to get hung up on them.

A major technological breakthrough...	Back to the drawing board.
Developed after years of research	Discovered by pure accident.

Designs are within allowable limits	We made it, stretching a point or two.
Customer satisfaction is believed	So far behind schedule that they'll be

Test results were extremely gratifying	It works, and boy, were we surprised!

	all of my stuff."


Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired
signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not
fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.  This world in arms is not
spending money alone.  It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the
genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.  This is not a way
of life at all in any true sense.  Under the clouds of war, it is
humanity hanging on a cross of iron.
		-- Dwight D. Eisenhower, April 16, 1953


Cats are smarter than dogs.  You can't make eight cats pull
