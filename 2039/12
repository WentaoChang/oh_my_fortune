yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity.

Detroit is Cleveland without the glitter.


Women's Libbers are OK, I just wouldn't want my sister to marry one.


So you're back... about time...

The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;
The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change.
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
		-- William Shakespeare, "Richard II"


A wife lasts only for the length of the marriage, but an ex-wife is there
