The real problem with hunting elephants carrying the decoys.


When a fly lands on the ceiling, does it do a half roll or a half

QOTD:
	"... was it a dream where you see yourself standing in sort-of
	Sun-God robes, on a pyramid, with a thousand naked women screaming
	and throwing little pickles at you?  ...  Why am I the only one
	who has that dream?"


The bigger the theory the better.
