	Babies should enjoy the freedom to vocalize, whether it be in church,
	a public meeting place, during a movie, or after hours when the

Under the wide and starry sky,
Dig my grave and let me lie,
Glad did I live and gladly die,
And laid me down with a will,

Here he lies where he longed to be,
Home is the sailor home from the sea,
And the hunter home from the hill.
