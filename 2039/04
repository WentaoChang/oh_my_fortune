There's little in taking or giving,
	There's little in water or wine:
This living, this living, this living,
	Was never a project of mine.
Oh, hard is the struggle, and sparse is
	The gain of the one at the top,
For art is a form of catharsis,
	And love is a permanent flop,
And work is the province of cattle,
	And rest's for a clam in a shell,
So I'm thinking of throwing the battle --
	Would you kindly direct me to hell?
		-- Dorothy Parker

blound by the sun and he dropped it.

Never pay a compliment as if expecting a receipt.


All [zoos] actually offer to the public in return for the taxes spent
upon them is a form of idle and witless amusement, compared to which a
visit to a penitentiary, or even to a State legislature in session, is
informing, stimulating and ennobling.

jumped out and beat at the fire with their coats, miraculously bringing the
blaze under control.

What nobody is sure about.

It knows that one cannot relax

In spite of all my favorite hacks
	My jobs it always thrashes!
