Beware of self-styled experts: an ex is a has-been, and a spurt is a
drip under pressure.


Oh give me a home, where the bookmakers roam,
Where the beer and the whiskey flows free,
Where never is heard, a discouraging word,
And the call-girls keep callin' for me!


Our houseplants have a good sense of humous.
