Beware of self-styled experts: an ex is a has-been, and a spurt is a
drip under pressure.


Oh give me a home, where the bookmakers roam,
Where the beer and the whiskey flows free,
Where never is heard, a discouraging word,
And the call-girls keep callin' for me!


Our houseplants have a good sense of humous.


Teach children to be polite and courteous in the home, and,
when they grow up, they won't be able to edge a car onto a freeway.


QOTD:
	"To hell with patience, I'm gonna kill me something!"


Sometimes when I get up in the morning, I feel very peculiar.  I feel
like I've just got to bite a cat!  I feel like if I don't bite a cat
before sundown, I'll go crazy!  But then I just take a deep breath and
forget about it.  That's what is known as real maturity.

If you think sex is a pain in the ass, try a different position.


Yes, I was surprised how easy it was to cut the door off my cat.
