If you notice that a person is deceiving you,
they must not be deceiving you very well.


Beat me, bite me, whip me, fuck me, make me write bad checks!


Weiler's Law:
	Nothing is impossible for the man who doesn't have to do it
	himself.


When nothing can possibly go wrong, it will.

A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.
Therefore, a man without a woman is like a bicycle without a fish.
