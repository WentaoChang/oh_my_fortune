That reminds me of a friend of mine who went north to work on the Alaskan
pipeline.  Before he went up there, he was just a skinny little runt.  When
he got back, he was a husky fucker.


The man who sees, on New Year's day, Mount
Fuji, a hawk, and an eggplant is forever blessed.

The shy young man had been married for three months when he reported to his
doctor that his marriage was still in name only.  The doctor, after hearing
the sad tale, told him that waiting until bedtime to make advances was causing
psychological pressure and advised him to take advantage of the next time he
felt in the mood.  A week later, the doctor happened to meet the man again,
and noticed a new spring in his step.  "My advice worked, I take it?" he

supper, and as I reached for the salt -- so did she!  Our hands touched... It

dishes from the table and then and there consummated our marriage!  There's
