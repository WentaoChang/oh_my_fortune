We thank with brief thanksgiving,
Whatever gods may be,
That no life lives forever,
That dead men rise up never,
That even the weariest river winds somewhere safe to sea.
		-- Swinburne

in it will be happier than those who have grown up in our society or those of
the past.
		-- Joseph Wood Krutch


Did you hear about the new German microwave oven?
		... Seats 500.


You probably wouldn't worry about what people
think of you if you could know how seldom they do.
