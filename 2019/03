Do you know, I think that Dr. Swift was silly to laugh about Laputa.
I believe it is a mistake to make a mock of people, just because they
think.  There are ninety thousand people in this world who do not
think, for every one who does, and these people hate the thinkers
like poison.  Even if some thinkers are fanciful, it is wrong to make
fun of them for it.  Better to think about cucumbers even, than not
to think at all.

Art is anything you can get away with.
		-- Marshall McLuhan


What luck for the rulers that men do not think.

to you.  You gonna pay it?


Remember: Silly is a state of Mind, Stupid is a way of Life.

Never worry about theory as long as the
machinery does what it's supposed to do.
