My own life has been spent chronicling the rise and fall of human systems,
and I am convinced that we are terribly vulnerable.  ...  We should be
reluctant to turn back upon the frontier of this epoch. Space is indifferent

If I want your opinion, I'll ask you to fill out the necessary form.


Paul's Law:

What's the ugliest part of your body?
What's the ugliest part of your body?
Some say your nose,
Some say your toes,
But I think it's your mind.

A liberal is a person whose interests aren't at stake at the moment.
