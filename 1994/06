Rainy days and automatic weapons always get me down.


	Two women were walking down the street, when one nudges the other
and says, "There's my husband coming out of the florist's with a dozen
roses, damn it.  That means I'll have to keep my legs up in the air for
three days."
	Replies her friend, "Well, why don't you buy a vase?"



Marriage is like twirling a baton, turning handsprings, or eating with
chopsticks.  It looks easy until you try it.


Patience is long forgotten by convenience in this life.
		-- Carmen Caicedo Giraudy


I've finally found the perfect girl,
I couldn't ask for more,
She's deaf and dumb and over-sexed,
And owns a liquor store.
