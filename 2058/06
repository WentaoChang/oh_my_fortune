In a five year period we can get one superb programming language.
Only we can't control when the five year period will begin.


You are scrupulously honest, frank, and straightforward.
Therefore you have few friends.


No use getting too involved in life --
you're only here for a limited time.


Any instrument when dropped will roll into the least accessible corner.


I'd love to go out with you, but the last time I went out, I never
came back.


Fill what's empty, empty what's full, scratch where it itches.

Bridge ahead.  Pay troll.


We don't smoke and we don't chew, and we don't go with girls that do.

"You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,
	And make errors few people could bear;
You complain about everyone's English but yours --
	Do you really think this is quite fair?"

"I make lots of mistakes," Father William declared,
	"But my stature these days is so great
That no critic can hurt me -- I've got them all scared,
	And to stop me it's now far too late."

The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to constants;
instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 at every appearance, the
variable PI can be given that value with a DATA statement and used instead
of the longer form of the constant.  This also simplifies modifying the
program, should the value of pi change.

Where a calculator on the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and
weighs 30 tons, computers in the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes
and perhaps weigh 1 1/2 tons.
