	"That wife of mine is a liar," said the angry husband to a
sympathetic pal seated next to him in a bar.

Remember thee
Ay, thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe.  Remember thee!

All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
That youth and observation copied there.
		-- William Shakespeare, "Hamlet"
