The worst is enemy of the bad.


Don't be humble, you're not that great.
		-- Golda Meir


If we could sell our experiences for what they cost us, we would
all be millionaires.
		-- Abigail Van Buren


Lipstick on your dipstick told a tale on you,
Lipstick on your dipstick said you were untrue.
Bet your bottom dollar you and I are through,
'Cause lipstick on your dipstick told a tale on you.
		-- To the tune of "Lipstick On Your Collar"
