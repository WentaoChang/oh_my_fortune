Lipstick on your dipstick told a tale on you,
Lipstick on your dipstick said you were untrue.

Just when you thought you were winning the rat race, along comes a
faster rat!!!


Said a madam named Mamie La Farge
To a sailor just off of a barge,
	"We have one girl that's dead,
	With a hole in her head--
Of course there's a slight extra charge."


It was raining heavily, and the motorist had car trouble on a lonely country
road.  Anxious to find shelter for the night, he walked over to a farmhouse
and knocked on the front door.  No one responded.  He could feel the water
from the roof running down the back of his neck as he stood on the stoop.
The next time he knocked louder, but still no answer.  By now he was soaked
to the skin.  Desperately he pounded on the door.  At last the head of a
man appeared out of an upstairs window.
	"What do you want?" he asked gruffly.
	"My car broke down," said the traveler, "and I want to know if you
would let me stay here for the night."
	"Sure," replied the man. "If you want to stay there all night, it's
okay with me."


QOTD:
	"It's been real and it's been fun, but it hasn't been real fun."


Your happiness is intertwined with your outlook on life.


Common sense is instinct, and enough of it is genius.

I was having sex just the other night, but she hung up.


One expresses well the love he does not feel.

The most hopelessly stupid man is he who is not aware that he is wise.


Dr. Fritzkee's Lucky Astrology Diet

The problem with the diets of today is that most women who do achieve
that magic weight, seventy-six pounds, are still fat.  Dr. Fritzkee's
Lucky Astrology Diet is a sure-fire method of reducing with the added
luxury that you never feel hungry.

Here's how the diet works:

	FOODS ALLOWED
First Month:	One egg
Second Month:	A raisin
Third Month:	Pumpkin pie with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.

If after the third month you haven't gotten to your dream weight, try
lopping off parts of your body until those scales tip just right for you.


Meanwhile back at the oasis, the Ay-rabs wuz busy a-eatin' their dates!


Ad astra per aspera.  (To the stars by aspiration.)
