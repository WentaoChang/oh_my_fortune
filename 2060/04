Dear Lord: Please make my words sweet and tender, for tomorrow I may
have to eat them.


If you don't like the way I drive, stay off the sidewalk!


Do Miami a favor.  When you leave, take someone with you.


Why is it called a funny bone when it hurts so much?


When arguments fail, use a blackjack.

Serving coffee on an aircraft causes turbulence.
