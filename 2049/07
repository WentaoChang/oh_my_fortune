directory, have won their first victory against the evil Administrative Empire.
During the battle, User spies managed to steal secret source code to the

	I paid a visit to my local precinct in Greenwich Village and
asked a sergeant to show me some rape statistics.  He politely obliged.
That month there had been thirty-five rape complaints, an advance of ten
over the same month for the previous year.  The precinct had made two
arrests.

	"Prostitutes who didn't get their money," he said firmly,
closing the book.
