Peterson's Admonition:
	When you think you're going down for the third time --
	just remember that you may have counted wrong.


Have you heard of the lady named Cox
Who had a capacious old box?
	When her lover was in place
	She said, "Please turn your face.
I look like a gal, but I screw like a fox."


The life which is unexamined is not worth living.
