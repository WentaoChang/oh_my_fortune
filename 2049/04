Her locks an ancient lady gave
Her loving husband's life to save;
And men -- they honored so the dame --
Upon some stars bestowed her name.

Who'd give their lords to save their hair,
No stellar recognition's given.
There are not stars enough in heaven.


Imagine what we can imagine!
		-- Arthur Rubinstein
