PARTY:
	A gathering where you meet people who drink
	so much you can't even remember their names.


Parents often talk about the younger generation as if they
didn't have much of anything to do with it.


The difficult we do today; the impossible takes a little longer.


The reason that sex is so popular is that it's centrally located.


They went rushing down that freeway,
Messed around and got lost.
They didn't care... they were just dying to get off,
And it was life in the fast lane.
		-- Eagles, "Life in the Fast Lane"
