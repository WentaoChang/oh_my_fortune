Messed around and got lost.

As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't
as easy to get programs right as we had thought.  Debugging had to be

Eli and Bessie went to sleep.
In the middle of the night, Bessie nudged Eli.

	And later, a groom
Saw her rolling about in the gorse.
		-- Edward Gorey


When the English language gets in my way, I walk over it.

The difference between sentiment and sentimentality is easy to see.  When
you avoid killing somebody's pet on the glazeway, that's sentiment.  If you
swerve to avoid the pet and that causes you to kill pedestrians, THAT is
sentimentality.
		-- Frank Herbert, "Chapterhouse: Dune"
