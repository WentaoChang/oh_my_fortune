Poorman's Rule:
	When you pull a plastic garbage bag from its handy dispenser
	package, you always get hold of the closed end and try to
	pull it open.


Try to value useful qualities in one who loves you.


He who trains his tongue to quote the learned
sages, will be known far and wide as a smart ass.
