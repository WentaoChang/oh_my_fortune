The introduction of a new kind of music must be shunned as imperiling
the whole state, for styles of music are never disturbed without
affecting the most important political institutions. ...  The new
style, gradually gaining a lodgement, quietly insinuates itself into
manners and customs, and from it ... goes on to attack laws and
constitutions, displaying the utmost impudence, until it ends by
overturning everything.
		-- Plato, "Republic", 370 B.C.


You will obey or molten silver will be poured into your ears.


You can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose, but you can't
pick your friend's nose.


God is not dead.  He is alive and well and working on a
much less ambitious project.
