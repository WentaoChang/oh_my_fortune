An Ada exception is when a routine gets
in trouble and says "Beam me up, Scotty."


That reminds me of a friend of mine who went north to work on the Alaskan

he got back, he was a husky fucker.


Your mode of life will be changed for
the better because of good news soon.


Love is always open arms.  With arms open you allow love to come and
go as it wills, freely, for it will do so anyway.  If you close your
arms about love you'll find you are left only holding yourself.


Despite all appearances, your boss
is a thinking, feeling, human being.


You are a bundle of energy, always on the go.
