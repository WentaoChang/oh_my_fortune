My brother-in-law has found a way to make ends meet.  He goes around
with his head stuck up his ass.


Courage is your greatest present need.


Q:	Why are babies born with soft spots on their heads?
A:	So you can pick 'em up five at a time.


The good time is approaching,
The season is at hand.
When the merry click of the two-base lick
Will be heard throughout the land.
The frost still lingers on the earth, and
Budless are the trees.
But the merry ring of the voice of spring
Is borne upon the breeze.
		-- Ode to Opening Day, "The Sporting News", 1886
