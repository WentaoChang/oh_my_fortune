	A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software
conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying: "What sort
of programmers work for other companies?  They behaved badly and were
unconcerned with appearances. Their hair was long and unkempt and their
clothes were wrinkled and old. They crashed our hospitality suites and they
made rude noises during my presentation."
	The manager said: "I should have never sent you to the conference.
Those programmers live beyond the physical world.  They consider life absurd,
an accidental coincidence.  They come and go without knowing limitations.
Without a care, they live only for their programs.  Why should they bother
with social conventions?"
	"They are alive within the Tao."

Do you smoke after sex?
Why, do you know, I've never looked!


Real programmers don't document; if it was
hard to write, it should be hard to understand.


Best of all is never to have been born.
Second best is to die soon.


Algebraic symbols are used when you do not know what you are talking about.
