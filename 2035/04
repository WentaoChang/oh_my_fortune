Man is a military animal,
Glories in gunpowder, and loves parade.
		-- P. J. Bailey


We only acknowledge small faults in order
to make it appear that we are free from great ones.

Hofstadter's Law:
	It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take
	Hofstadter's Law into account.


Notes for a ballet, "The Spell": ... Suddenly Sigmund hears the flutter of
wings, and a group of wild swans flies across the moon ... Sigmund is
astounded to see that their leader is part swan and part woman --
unfortunately, divided lengthwise.  She enchants Sigmund, who is careful
not to make any poultry jokes.
		-- Woody Allen


Stay together, drag each other down.
