Loose bits sink chips.


So, good night, you moonlit ladies,
Rock-a-bye sweet baby James.
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose,
Won't you let me go down in my dreams?
And rock-a-bye sweet baby James.
		-- James Taylor, "Rock-a-bye Sweet Baby James"


Meanwhile back at the oasis, the Ay-rabs wuz busy a-eatin' their dates!


Dyslexics have more fnu.


You can beat my meat, but you can't lick my sauce!
