It proves what they say, give the public what they want to see and
they'll come out for it.

To lynch all the robots they can.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of APL, I shall

It is a mistake to let any mechanical object
realise that you are in a hurry.


Oh give me a home, where the bookmakers roam,
Where the beer and the whiskey flows free,
Where never is heard, a discouraging word,
And the call-girls keep callin' for me!

When two people are under the influence of the most violent, most
insane, most delusive, and most transient of passions, they are

exhausting condition continuously until death do them part.

<Daibashiw> Wasn't EMACS originally developed as a swap memory stresser,

Kerr's Three Rules for a Successful College:
	Have plenty of football for the alumni, sex
	for the students, and parking for the faculty.


Back in the early 60's, touch tone phones only had 10 buttons.  Some
military versions had 16, while the 12 button jobs were used only by people
who had "diva" (digital inquiry, voice answerback) systems -- mainly banks.
Since in those days, only Western Electric made "data sets" (modems) the
problems of terminology were all Bell System.  We used to struggle with
written descriptions of dial pads that were unfamiliar to most people
(most phones were rotary then.)  Partly in jest, some AT&T engineering
types (there was no marketing in the good old days, which is why they were
the good old days) made up the term "octalthorpe" (note spelling) to denote
the "pound sign."  Presumably because it has 8 points sticking out.  It
never really caught on.

and according to convention, there is an order.  In truth, there are atoms
and a void.

Inglish Spocken Hier: some mangled translations

	Sign on a cathedral in Spain:

	Above the entrance to a Cairo bar:
		Unaccompanied ladies not admitted unless with husband
		or similar.

		The lift is being fixed for the next days.
		During that time we regret that you will be unbearable.

		-- Colin Bowles


Hating the Yankees is as American as pizza pie,
unwed mothers and cheating on your income tax.
		-- Mike Royko


The major sin is the sin of being born.
		-- Samuel Beckett


I reverently believe that the maker who made us all makes everything in New
England, but the weather.  I don't know who makes that, but I think it must be
raw apprentices in the weather-clerks factory who experiment and learn how, in
New England, for board and clothes, and then are promoted to make weather for
countries that require a good article, and will take their custom elsewhere
if they don't get it.
		-- Mark Twain


Everything that you know is wrong, but you can be straightened out.
