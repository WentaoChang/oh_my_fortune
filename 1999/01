age.  You're constantly terrified that they're going to randomly die on
you, but the rules for preventing that outcome are straightforward and

The strong individual loves the earth so much he lusts for recurrence.  He
can smile in the face of the most terrible thought: meaningless, aimless
existence recurring eternally.  The second characteristic of such a man is
that he has the strength to recognize -- and to live with the recognition --
that the world is valueless in itself and that all values are human ones.
He creates himself by fashioning his own values; he has the pride to live
by the values he wills.
		-- Friedrich Nietzsche

3:	If Johnson drinks one beer the first hour (slow start), four beers
