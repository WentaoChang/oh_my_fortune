Now that day wearies me,
My yearning desire
Will receive more kindly,
Like a tired child, the starry night.

Hands, leave off your deeds,
Mind, forget all thoughts;
All of my forces
Yearn only to sink into sleep.

And my soul, unguarded,
Would soar on widespread wings,
To live in night's magical sphere
More profoundly, more variously.
		-- Hermann Hesse, "Going to Sleep"


I really had to act; 'cause I didn't have any lines.

set, and it is suggested that "fortune -a" is the command that you
should have in your .profile or .cshrc. file.

Got his testicles caught in a wringer.
