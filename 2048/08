	"It will take one year," said the master promptly.
	"But we need this system immediately or even sooner!  How long will it

	"And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it?"
	The master programmer shrugged.  "Then the design will never be
completed," he said.

That reminds me of a friend of mine who went north to work on the Alaskan
