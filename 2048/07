The world has many unintentionally cruel mechanisms that are not
designed for people who walk on their hands.

Reclaimer, spare that tree!

Now, GC, for the nonce,
Thou shalt reclaim it not.


Here lies my wife: her let her lie!

continuous stampede of patriotic fervor -- with the cry of grave national
emergency...  Always there has been some terrible evil to gobble us up if we
did not blindly rally behind it by furnishing the exorbitant sums demanded.
Yet, in retrospect, these disasters seem never to have happened, seem never
to have been quite real.
		-- General Douglas MacArthur, 1957


I hate trolls.  Maybe I could metamorph it into something else -- like a
