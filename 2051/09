off with a $20 bribe, and later remarked thankfully, "I thought I

tiny closet in the White House Cabinet Room while Secret Service men
stood lookout.

It's so confusing choosing sides in the heat of the moment,
	just to see if it's real,
Oooh, it's so erotic having you tell me how it should feel,

So ask me just one question when this magic night is through,
Could it have been just anyone or did it have to be you?
		-- Billy Joel, "Glass Houses"
