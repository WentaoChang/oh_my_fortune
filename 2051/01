Once you come out as a Pagan bisexual married leatherdyke,
the rest of life is that much easier.


It is better to kiss an avocado than to get in a fight with an aardvark.


Q:	Why do dogs lick their private parts?
A:	Because they can.


Have you noticed that all you need to grow healthy,
vigorous grass is a crack in your sidewalk?


Where, oh, where, are you tonight?
Why did you leave me here all alone?
I searched the world over, and I thought I'd found true love.
You met another, and *PPHHHLLLBBBBTTT*, you wuz gone.

Gloom, despair and agony on me.
Deep dark depression, excessive misery.
If it weren't for bad luck, I'd have no luck at all.
Oh, gloom, despair and agony on me.
