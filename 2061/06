I've never been drunk, but often I've been overserved.
		-- George Gobel


If you are not for yourself, who will be for you?
If you are for yourself, then what are you?
If not now, when?


If you were attacked by a homosexual, would you beat him off?


He that would govern others, first should be the master of himself.


Your friends will know you better in the first minute you
meet than your acquaintances will know you in a thousand years.
		-- Richard Bach, "Illusions"
